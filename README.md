# Memory_Allocator

This program is designed to be ran through linux using the test file provided.
This C program serves as a basic memory allocator, managing a predefined heap of memory and providing functionality to allocate and free blocks within this heap. The memoryBlockHeader structure represents a block of memory in the heap, containing the size of the block and a pointer to the next block in the free list. The duInitMalloc() function initializes the memory allocator by setting all the memory in the heap to 0 and creating a single large free block that spans the entire heap. The duMemoryDump() function is a utility for debugging, printing the blocks of memory in the free list. The duMalloc(size_t size) function is the core of the allocator, attempting to allocate a block of memory of the requested size. It searches the free list for a suitable block, splits it if necessary, and updates the free list, returning a pointer to the allocated memory or NULL if the allocation fails. Lastly, the duFree(void* ptr) function frees a block of memory, adding it back to the free list. This basic memory allocator serves as a good starting point for understanding how memory allocation works, though it lacks some features of more complex allocators such as coalescing free blocks. It uses a first-fit strategy for finding free blocks, which may not always be the most efficient approach.
